* The id column is an auto-incrementing integer that serves as the primary key of the table.
* The story_id column is a non-null integer that references the id column in the stories table and specifies the story that the rating is for. If a story is deleted from the stories table, then all corresponding ratings will be automatically deleted from the story_ratings table due to the ON DELETE CASCADE constraint.
* The user_id column is a non-null integer that references the id column in the users table and specifies the story seeker who gave the rating. If a user is deleted from the users table, then all corresponding ratings will be automatically deleted from the story_ratings table due to the ON DELETE CASCADE constraint.
* The rating column is a non-null integer that specifies the rating given by the story seeker. The CHECK constraint ensures that the rating is between 1 and 5 (inclusive).
* The created_at column is a timestamp that specifies when the rating was created. The default value is the current timestamp.
* The updated_at column is a timestamp that specifies when the rating was last updated. The default value is the current timestamp, and it is automatically updated to the current timestamp whenever the rating is updated.
